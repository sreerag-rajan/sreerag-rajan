### Hi there, I am Sreerag Rajan!ðŸ‘‹

I am a aspiring web-developer seeking to make forays into the world of tech. I wish to work and contribute and leave a mark, no matter how small or big. Technology has come a long way in aiding our day to day life, and I too wish to be part of this adventure.

I am a Student of history, who has completed his masters on Modern Indian History, but was attracted to the journey of a web-developer. From building, deploying and seeing someone use what you built had me hooked. I seek to bring together best of both worlds and will venture to find ways of introducing technology into the world of humanities.

I am also a bibliophile who enjoys to not just read but also buy and maintain a personal library. 

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Fullstack Web Development
